# Mushroom-Classification-ML

# Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous, which is crucial due to the diverse and often ambiguous nature of mushroom species. The project utilizes the Mushroom records dataset, featuring various characteristics of mushrooms for these predictions.

# Objectives

- Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's features and their relationships.
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning through data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Develop various machine learning models for classifying mushrooms as either edible or poisonous.
- Extract and interpret insights from the models, focusing on key features influencing mushroom edibility.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy for numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for machine learning and data preprocessing.

# Features and Data Cleaning

The dataset contains multiple features that represent various characteristics of mushrooms. Data cleaning involved handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

# Conclusion and Insights

The project successfully developed high-accuracy models for predicting mushroom edibility. It highlighted key features and their impact on the models' predictions, offering valuable insights into mushroom classification.
